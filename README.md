# Django Signals Project

## Description
This project explores how Django signals behave by default in terms of execution (synchronous/asynchronous), threading, and database transactions. 
Through examples and code snippets, we aim to demonstrate the behavior of Django signals in real-world scenarios.

The three main questions covered in this project are:
1. Are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously by default?
2. Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
3. Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?
